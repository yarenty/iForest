Isolation Forest
================

or  Multi-Objective Anomaly Detection


## Concept

1) no more looking into any single column
2) build model for whole data (no Ys, all Xs)
3) in that data predict which points are most likely anomalies
4) all of this is fully unsupervised!!

## Result
Using time series: @todo.
